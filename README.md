# pepsimodLauncher

## DEPRECATED

The launcher for pepsimod, this downloads classes, decrypts them and uses classloader hackery to make them load.

Generally speaking, it almost never works correctly, and when it does, it freezes the JVM a lot.  I don't **WANT** to try and fix this, as it's super hacky code slammed together by 14-year-old me and I don't even remember exactly why most of it is there, and removing a debug message can sometimes be the difference between a JVM crash and a perfect launch.

Currently only keeping this repo around for posterity, if anyone ever decides to fix it or use it for another project feel free, so long as I'm credited.
